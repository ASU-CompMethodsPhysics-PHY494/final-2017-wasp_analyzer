CONTRIBUTIONS

ed-escalante:

ed-escalante has been playing a pivotal role in the ideation process of the entire project. He used his
analytical skills to valuably contribute to and lead the algorithm development of the project’s WASP55
simulation that is under the name “r_brightness.py”. Through doing this, he has been able to greatly
steer the project in the right direction. While collaborating with KezmanSaboi and TianchengGong, he is at the
moment trying to integrate the transit of WASP55 b across WASP55 in the code that the team currently
has.

KezmanSaboi:

To kick-start the project, KezmanSaboi developed and wrote the project proposal clearly stating
formulae needed as well as the goals needed to be ultimately achieved from the entire project. He has
been actively involved in the ideation process of figuring out how key and non-trivial parts of the
project, such as the simulation of WASP55, can be achieved. He initially developed a short algorithm in
VPython to observe the orbital movements of WASP55 b around WASP55. Additionally, he has been
involved in researching ways in which an efficient and well-functioning algorithm can be developed to
ultimately enable the team achieve its desired goals that are clearly outlined in the project proposal.


TianchengGong:

TianchengGong has helped in establishing the useful functions that are required to calculate the
wanted light curves of WASP55 b’s transit across WASP55. He has been editing the “r_brightness.py”
code to make it process a better matrix. He has also been actively involved in the team’s brainstorming
meetings.
